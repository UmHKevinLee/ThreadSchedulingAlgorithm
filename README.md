# ThreadSchedulingAlgorithm
Comparing Scheduling Algorithms

The purpose of this homework is to build a scheduler to compare performance of a First In First Out (FIFO) versus Round Robin algorithms.  The algorithms will be tested assuming a single processor and multi-processor configurations of 2-4 processors.  You can use Java or another programming language (with threads) using producer/consumer logic to emulate an actual O.S. implementation.
